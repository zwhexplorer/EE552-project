Introduction

Motivated by industrial large-scale spiking neural networks TrueNorth and Loihi, we propose as a class project to model and implement a machine learning accelerator using an array of processing elements described using SystemVerilogCSP. Unlike TrueNorth and Loihi, however, we will target more traditional machine learning algorithms (e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNN)) and include a discussion of how CNNs have been mapped to asynchronous Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). This will focus on the application of this technology in a domain that is quite relevant to todayâ€™s chip designers.
The class project will involve modeling the behavior of the neurons and associated network on chip (NoC) as well as implementing components in an asynchronous design style. The project will thus include aspects of architecture, micro-architecture, circuit design, modeling, and verification.
The class project will be broken into several phases. Students will self-organize into teams of 1, 2, or 3 students and grades will be given to each team (special permission from Prof. Beerel needed for teams of 4). It will include a required report (at least 10 pages) and class presentation that will be graded for both content and clarity. All students are expected to participate in the class presentation which is expected to be 8 minutes long. If needed due to time constraints some presentations will be held outside of normal class times.
